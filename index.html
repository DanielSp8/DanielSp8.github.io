When I was 10 years old, I found myself intrigued by computers. I came across a book on GWBasic, and I was struck by both the challenging aspect of it alongside the ability to create through coding.</p><p class="lead">My Father saw interest developing, and he gave me a Visual Basic suite along with its books. I dreamed of a career in the field of computer programming.</p><div class="bg-white p-5 rounded my-5 shadow-sm"><p class="lead font-italic mb-0 text-muted">For different reasons, I got away from my passion for programming. Now, I'm rediscovering the enjoyment for coding I once studied and practiced.</p></div><p class="lead">A few years ago, within my heart, there was a stirring for programming taking place. I spent time researching coding boot camps, and found the price was usually outrageous. So... I attempted to study on my own. I started with the language of C, moved to C Sharp, and also read other resources such as Programmatic Programmer and Clean Code.</p><p class="lead">I also spent some time taking some Udemy courses and watching other tutorials.</p><p class="lead">There's so much to learn and much of it is so challenging! I hit some walls, backed off. I signed back up again, studied hard. I figuratively struck my head against the wall more than once.</p><p class="lead">All the while, I kept a journal of my study hours and documented what I studied.</p></div><div class="col-lg-5"><p class="lead">In the midst of a desire for an enjoyable career of programming, I came across a reasonably priced boot camp called Nucamp.</p><p class="lead">I started by learning about the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, along with JavaScript.</p><p class="lead">In Nucamp's Full Stack boot camp, I learned Bootstrap. I was also pushed to learn React to build websites.</p><p class="lead">Soon after, I learned some of React Native, in order to build cross-platform mobile apps. I also had a course on backend development, which focused on NodeJS, Express and MongoDB.</p></div></div></div><script src="js/main.js"></script></body></html>
